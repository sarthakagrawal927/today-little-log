> **ARCHIVED 2026-07-02 — Merged into [significanthobbies](../significanthobbies).**
> This repo is no longer actively developed. The daily ritual (habits,

> See `significanthobbies/docs/MERGE_PLAN.md` for details.

## Shared Fleet Standard

Also read and follow the shared fleet-level agent standard at `../AGENTS.md`. Treat this repository as owned product code: protect production stability, keep changes scoped, verify work, and record durable follow-up tasks when something remains incomplete or blocked.

## Purpose
Personal life PWA. Daily Scoreboard (user-defined check/output items, no-zero-day streak) + AM/PM rituals + journal + habits + Eisenhower tasks + memento mori life grid.

## Stack
- React 19 SPA (React Router v7), Vite 8, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui (Radix)
- Turso (libSQL) + Drizzle ORM, migrations in `drizzle/migrations/`
- better-auth (Google provider) — sessions in Turso `session` table
- Playwright e2e (`tests/`)
- Cloudflare Pages — `dist/` static + `functions/api/*` Pages Functions
- pnpm

```

## Key commands
```bash
pnpm dev        # vite (localhost:8080)
pnpm build      # vite build → dist/
pnpm preview    # vite preview
pnpm test:e2e   # playwright
pnpm lint       # biome check .
pnpm run deploy # vite build + wrangler pages deploy dist/
```

## Architecture notes

- **Single schema**: `src/db/schema.ts` is the only schema file. Drizzle migrations + CF Pages functions both import from it. No duplicate.
- **CF Pages routing**: `[resource].ts` matches single-segment `/api/<x>`. Exact-match files (`scoreboard-items.ts`, `scoreboard-logs.ts`) win when name collides. `auth/[[all]].ts` catches `/api/auth/*`.
- **CF Pages auth**: `functions/api/auth/[[all]].ts` builds a better-auth instance per request from `context.env`. Web-standard fetch API.
- **`requireUserId(request, env, db)`**: in `functions/api/_helpers.ts` — returns `userId` or `null`. All data routes auth-gate via this.
- **Secrets**: stored as CF Pages encrypted secrets (`wrangler pages secret put`):
  `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`,
  `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`. `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is plaintext in `wrangler.toml [vars]`.
- **OAuth**: Google client `207924374505-...`. Authorized redirect URI must include
  `https://today-little-log.pages.dev/api/auth/callback/google` (and localhost for dev).
- **Deploy gotcha**: CF Pages git auto-deploy has stripped functions in the past — always deploy via `pnpm run deploy` (manual wrangler). Recommend disabling Git integration in CF dashboard.
- **PWA**: `vite-plugin-pwa` + Workbox, `registerType: autoUpdate` + `skipWaiting` + `clientsClaim` so new bundles activate immediately on next nav.
- **TanStack Query**: optional — most hooks use plain useState + apiFetch.
- **Gamification**: kept = XP + StreakBadge. Removed = Mana, LifeScore, PSI badges (PSI score still scored in AmRitual).
- **AI config** read from `localStorage['chatbot-ai-config']` via a small local helper in `src/lib/psiScore.ts` (no `@saas-maker/ai` package); chat goes through `/api/chat` to the free-ai gateway.
- **Pre-push gates**: lint, tsc, build, secret-scan. No skip without reason.

## Fleet Guidance

### Adding Tasks
- Add durable work items in SaaS Maker Cockpit Tasks when the task affects product behavior, deployment, user feedback, or fleet maintenance.
- Include the project slug, a concise title, acceptance criteria, priority/status, and links to relevant code, issues, traces, or dashboards.
- If task discovery starts locally in an editor or agent session, mirror the durable next step back into SaaS Maker before handoff.

### Using SaaS Maker
- Treat SaaS Maker as the system of record for project metadata, feedback, tasks, analytics, testimonials, changelog, and fleet visibility.
- Prefer API-first workflows through `fnd api`, the SDK, or widgets instead of one-off scripts when interacting with SaaS Maker features.
- Keep this agent file aligned with the project record when operating rules, integrations, or deployment conventions change.

### Free AI First
- Prefer free/local AI paths for routine development and analysis: the `free-ai` gateway, local models, provider free tiers, and cached context.
- Escalate to paid models only when complexity, correctness risk, or missing capability justifies the cost.
- Note any paid-AI use in the task or handoff when it materially affects cost, reproducibility, or future maintenance.

<!-- FLEET-GUIDANCE:END -->

## Active context
- Scoreboard live, ~7 default items seeded for primary user.
- Home is hero + Scoreboard + Today entry only. Other surfaces split to dedicated pages.
- Aggressive prune `9631951` removed 9 pages + 20 components + 11 hooks; `25625a2` restored Review/Memories/Rituals/Focus/IdentitySetter as separate pages.
